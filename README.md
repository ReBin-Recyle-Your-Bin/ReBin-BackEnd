## ReBin Project Background
The issue of waste in Indonesia has become increasingly complex, with communities generating 17.6 million tons of waste annually, of which only 67.4% is effectively managed. This leaves 32.6% of waste unmanaged due to low awareness of waste management practices, resulting in environmental pollution, health issues, and economic losses. A significant challenge is the identification and proper management of various waste types, worsened by inadequate education on disposal and recycling. Our goal is to address these challenges with an innovative solution: an application that accurately identifies waste types, educates on recycling processes, and promotes sustainable waste management practices nationwide.

## Cloud Computing Part in the Project
Build RESTful APIs using Node.js and the Express framework for the backend, prepare MongoDB as the database, and deploy the backend and machine learning model on Google Cloud Platform.
